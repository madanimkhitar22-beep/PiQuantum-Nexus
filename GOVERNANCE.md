# ⚖️ PiQuantum Nexus Governance Framework

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Protocol License:** Pi Open Source License (PiOS)  
**Aligned With:** PiTrust Infrastructure Protocol

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The PiQuantum Nexus governance framework defines how decisions are made, verified, and enforced across the quantum intelligence layer. It ensures transparency, accountability, and community-driven evolution within the Pi Network ecosystem.

---

## 🧩 Governance Layers

1. **Core Council (PiTrust)**
   - Oversees protocol updates and standard compliance.
   - Verifies integrity of quantum encryption and interoperability.

2. **Validator Nodes (PiNet OS)**
   - Participate in distributed consensus and computational validation.
   - Manage workload balancing and error resilience.

3. **Community Delegates (Pioneers)**
   - Represent users through decentralized voting mechanisms.
   - Contribute to proposals, bug bounties, and improvement requests.

## 🔐 Decision Protocol

| Governance Action | Responsible Entity | Approval Threshold |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Quantum Security Update | Core Council | 80% |
| Integration with PiBridge / PiStorage | Validator Consensus | 67% |
| Economic Parameter Change | Community Delegates | 51% |
| Emergency System Patch | Core Council | 100% immediate authorization |

## 📜 Governance Principles

- **Transparency:** All governance votes and proposals are recorded on-chain.  
- **Accountability:** Each decision includes verifiable digital signatures.  
- **Resilience:** The system maintains operation even under partial failure.  
- **Inclusion:** Every verified Pioneer can propose or vote via Pi ID.

## 🧠 Smart Governance Engine

PiQuantum Nexus includes an AI-assisted governance layer that:
- Predicts governance outcomes and potential network risks.
- Analyzes proposals based on fairness, impact, and alignment with PiOS.  
- Suggests optimizations while maintaining human oversight.

---

## 🪙 Incentive Model

- Active validator nodes receive **trust score boosts** and **Pi staking rewards**.  
- Community contributors earn recognition through the **PiTrust Reputation Index**.

---

## ✅ Final Statement

> Governance under PiQuantum Nexus is **transparent, participatory, and AI-augmented**, ensuring every network decision upholds security, equity, and innovation across the Pi Network ecosystem.
