# PiQuantum Nexus Protocol Specification

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Maintained by:** PiTrust Infrastructure Division

## Overview
PiQuantum Nexus introduces a decentralized intelligence layer for the Pi Network, secured by post-quantum cryptography and AI-optimized computation. It bridges the gap between classical and quantum data models within the Pi ecosystem.

## Core Architecture
- **Quantum-Resistant Layer:** Implements lattice-based encryption and key exchange.
- **AI-Driven Coordination:** Predictive mapping for quantum workloads.
- **Multi-Chain Synchronization:** Real-time interoperability with PiBridge and PiStorage.
- **Governance Integration:** Follows PiOS institutional standards and trust mechanisms via PiTrust.

## Communication Channels
- Encrypted communication through quantum-safe WebSocket tunnels.
- Secure REST APIs for cross-chain and AI coordination.
- Decentralized event logging with adaptive compression.

## Compliance
- ISO 27001 / SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR & PiOS Privacy Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Standard

## Future Expansion
Next iterations will support quantum key distribution (QKD) and hybrid computation orchestration via PiNet OS.
